/*
We need to complete a function called chooseRecipe(), which will receive three parameters: - An array of ingredients in stock at Bakery A - An array of ingredients in stock at Bakery B - An array of recipe objects. Each recipe has a name property(string) and an ingredient property(array)

We are limiting our search to two ingredient recipes. We want to find a recipe that utilizes one ingredient from Bakery A and one from Bakery B.

Our chooseRecipe() function should return the name of the correct recipe.
