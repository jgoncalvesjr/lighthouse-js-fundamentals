/*
In this activity, we will be converting date strings like "2017/12/02", into more English friendly date strings like December 2nd, 2017.

We will be given a date as a string (not a Date object). The date will always be formatted as YYYY/MM/DD. We will have to parse the given string and produce a human readable date.
