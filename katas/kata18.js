/*
In this kata you'll be responsible for setting up your JS file from scratch. Make sure it is well organized!

Write a guessing game where the user has to guess a secret number. After every guess the program tells the user whether their number was too large or too small. At the end, the number of tries needed should be printed.

Inputting the same number multiple times should only count as one try. If the user provides an answer which isn't a number, print an error message and do not count this as a try.
